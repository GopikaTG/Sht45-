Sht45-
Temperature Humidity sensor
Description

The ES-13513 SHT45 sensor probe is a high-accuracy +-0.1C and +-1% RH, ultra-low-power, 16-bit relative humidity and temperature sensor probe for measuring relative humidity and temperature at different environmental conditions. Its I2C interface provides preconfigured I2C address 0x44 and maintains an ultra-low power budget. The power-trimmed internal heater can be used at three heating levels thus enabling sensor operation in demanding environments. The sensor is individually tested and calibrated and is identifiable by its unique serial number.

The surface of the SHT45 sensor probe is covered with a waterproof and breathable membrane to protect it. The shell is waterproof and will keep water from seeping into the body of the sensor and damaging it, but allows air to pass through so that it can measure the humidity (moisture) of the environment. It has been widely used in HVAC, consumer goods, weather stations, test & measurement, automation, medical, and humidifiers, especially performing well in extreme environments like acid, alkali, corrosion, high temperature, and pressure.

The probe connector is Mini Round Shell MRS type and the wire length is 1 meter.

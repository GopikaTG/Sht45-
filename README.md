# Temperature Humidity sensor

The ES-13513 SHT45 sensor probe is a highly accurate device, boasting a precision of ±0.1°C for temperature and ±1% for relative humidity (RH). Operating on the I2C interface with a preconfigured address of 0x44, it maintains an impressively low power consumption, making it suitable for extended usage in various environmental conditions.Featuring a power-trimmed internal heater with three heating levels, it can operate reliably even in challenging environments. Each sensor is meticulously tested and calibrated, with a unique serial number for identification. Its surface is shielded by a waterproof and breathable membrane, ensuring protection against water ingress while allowing for accurate humidity measurements.The sensor's rugged construction, coupled with its waterproof shell, makes it resilient against harsh elements like acid, alkali, corrosion, high temperature, and pressure. Widely utilized across HVAC systems, consumer electronics, weather stations, automation, medical equipment, and humidifiers, it excels in extreme conditions.The probe connector adopts the Mini Round Shell (MRS) type, and its accompanying wire extends up to 1 meter, offering flexibility in installation and usage.
